# Decision log — ChatGoose (Fansly extension)

Append-only. Numbered entries, newest last. Cross-repo decisions live in
core's `docs/decisions.md` and are REFERENCED here, never copied.

## Family law (recorded per kernel Stage 35; binding in this repo)

- **Anti-deletion rule:** removing or superseding any hand-curated document
  requires a tombstone entry in this log; deprecated specs get a banner,
  never deletion. Generated docs (`docs/generated/`) are exempt.
- **Updated-in-change:** hand-curated docs are updated in the same change
  that invalidates them.
- **Cross-repo decisions** are recorded in core's log; this log points at
  them by number.

## Quick reference

| # | Date | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 1: npm/commonjs → pnpm/ESM, ESLint, CI lint |
| E2 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 2: @kernel/sdk vendored; device-token sign-in; storage v8 |
| E3 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 3: kernel-only AI; vendor host permissions removed; Settings v9 |
| E4 | 2026-07-06 | Compare/Multi rides fast-reply per card (kernel compare deferred — core #112 era deviation) |
| E5 | 2026-07-06 | clientContext on the feature lane (Fansly archive is pull-cadenced; extension reads live) |
| E6 | 2026-07-06 | Board = one kernel top-spenders query; legacy rebuild behind spendersLegacyRebuild for ONE release |
| E7 | 2026-07-06 | Released 1.6.0 (kernel AI + kernel board + acceptance telemetry) |

## Entries

**E1 (2026-07-06).** Toolchain to the family standard: `"type": "module"`,
pnpm pinned, ESLint flat config (content scripts may not import
background-only modules), CI runs `pnpm check`. 74 initial lint errors
driven to zero.

**E2 (2026-07-06).** `@kernel/sdk` vendored (`vendor/kernel-sdk`, generated
by core `scripts/vendor-sdk.mjs`; `link:` dependency so bundler resolution
applies; drift gate pins manifest hash == exported hash). The four legacy
hub routes ride validated SDK ops. Device-token sign-in uses the browser
cookie jar (`credentials: 'include'` — Set-Cookie is unreadable in
extensions); the legacy chatter key stays as dual-accepted fallback.
Storage schema v7→v8 (`agencyHubDeviceToken`).

**E3 (2026-07-06).** Stage 32 AI cutover: kernel feature lane only. Deleted
both vendor clients, price tables, model registry, the local prompt library
(kernel twins byte-verified through the named platform substitution),
prompt-injection, feature-readiness, the usage self-reporter. Settings v9
drops vendor keys + model/reasoning selections. `api.anthropic.com` and
`openrouter.ai` left `manifest.json` host permissions — direct calls are
structurally impossible. Gates: `scripts/check-ai-cutover.mjs` in
`pnpm check`. Core context: decisions #108–#111.

**E4 (2026-07-06).** A single-call kernel `compare` feature is DEFERRED:
kernel-held draft variants don't exist (prompts/drafts/ was absent from
shipped builds), so Multi runs the mapped persona card as one fast-reply
generation; local draft cards error explicitly (`compare_cards_unavailable`).

**E5 (2026-07-06).** The feature request carries `clientContext` (transcript,
counts, spending/subscription blocks): Fansly has no webhook lane and the
kernel archive is pull-cadenced (30 min / 24 h), while the extension reads
the conversation live at generation time. Prompt ASSEMBLY stays kernel-side.

**E6 (2026-07-06).** The spenders board reads ONE kernel query
(`pageTopSpenders` over the Stage 16 projection) instead of the ~150-call
per-fan Fansly sweep; one conversations enumeration remains as the
fan→groupId map (DP 1-B reader role). `builtAt` = the projection's freshest
observation. The legacy rebuild survives ONE release behind the hidden
`spendersLegacyRebuild` setting, then dies (with the legacy chatter-key
path).

**E7 (2026-07-06).** 1.6.0 signed and published
(`https://ext.gosling-agency.ru/updates.json`, sha256-pinned). §5
week-watch: fleet on the version header, kernel-only network panel +
measured quota drop, chatter walkthrough, acceptance observations under
producer `chatgoose-extension@1.6.0`.
