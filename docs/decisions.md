# Decision log — ChatGoose (Fansly extension)

Append-only. Numbered entries, newest last. Cross-repo decisions live in
core's `docs/decisions.md` and are REFERENCED here, never copied.

## Family law (recorded per kernel Stage 35; binding in this repo)

- **Anti-deletion rule:** removing or superseding any hand-curated document
  requires a tombstone entry in this log; deprecated specs get a banner,
  never deletion. Generated docs (`docs/generated/`) are exempt.
- **Updated-in-change:** hand-curated docs are updated in the same change
  that invalidates them.
- **Cross-repo decisions** are recorded in core's log; this log points at
  them by number.

## Quick reference

| # | Date | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 1: npm/commonjs → pnpm/ESM, ESLint, CI lint |
| E2 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 2: @kernel/sdk vendored; device-token sign-in; storage v8 |
| E3 | 2026-07-06 | Stage 32 Task 3: kernel-only AI; vendor host permissions removed; Settings v9 |
| E4 | 2026-07-06 | Compare/Multi rides fast-reply per card (kernel compare deferred — core #112 era deviation) |
| E5 | 2026-07-06 | clientContext on the feature lane (Fansly archive is pull-cadenced; extension reads live) |
| E6 | 2026-07-06 | Board = one kernel top-spenders query; legacy rebuild behind spendersLegacyRebuild for ONE release |
| E7 | 2026-07-06 | Released 1.6.0 (kernel AI + kernel board + acceptance telemetry) |
| E8 | 2026-07-07 | Map regen found + fixed unreachable device-token sign-in (missing protocol case); ships next release |
| E9 | 2026-07-07 | 1.7.0: device-token preferred in all hub ops; legacy board rebuild deleted (v11); chatter-key path deferred one release |
| E10 | 2026-07-07 | Pre-ship audit: Bearer-"set" poisoning, key-gated token flow, null-unsafe bearer — all fixed + pinned |

## Entries

**E1 (2026-07-06).** Toolchain to the family standard: `"type": "module"`,
pnpm pinned, ESLint flat config (content scripts may not import
background-only modules), CI runs `pnpm check`. 74 initial lint errors
driven to zero.

**E2 (2026-07-06).** `@kernel/sdk` vendored (`vendor/kernel-sdk`, generated
by core `scripts/vendor-sdk.mjs`; `link:` dependency so bundler resolution
applies; drift gate pins manifest hash == exported hash). The four legacy
hub routes ride validated SDK ops. Device-token sign-in uses the browser
cookie jar (`credentials: 'include'` — Set-Cookie is unreadable in
extensions); the legacy chatter key stays as dual-accepted fallback.
Storage schema v7→v8 (`agencyHubDeviceToken`).

**E3 (2026-07-06).** Stage 32 AI cutover: kernel feature lane only. Deleted
both vendor clients, price tables, model registry, the local prompt library
(kernel twins byte-verified through the named platform substitution),
prompt-injection, feature-readiness, the usage self-reporter. Settings v9
drops vendor keys + model/reasoning selections. `api.anthropic.com` and
`openrouter.ai` left `manifest.json` host permissions — direct calls are
structurally impossible. Gates: `scripts/check-ai-cutover.mjs` in
`pnpm check`. Core context: decisions #108–#111.

**E4 (2026-07-06).** A single-call kernel `compare` feature is DEFERRED:
kernel-held draft variants don't exist (prompts/drafts/ was absent from
shipped builds), so Multi runs the mapped persona card as one fast-reply
generation; local draft cards error explicitly (`compare_cards_unavailable`).

**E5 (2026-07-06).** The feature request carries `clientContext` (transcript,
counts, spending/subscription blocks): Fansly has no webhook lane and the
kernel archive is pull-cadenced (30 min / 24 h), while the extension reads
the conversation live at generation time. Prompt ASSEMBLY stays kernel-side.

**E6 (2026-07-06).** The spenders board reads ONE kernel query
(`pageTopSpenders` over the Stage 16 projection) instead of the ~150-call
per-fan Fansly sweep; one conversations enumeration remains as the
fan→groupId map (DP 1-B reader role). `builtAt` = the projection's freshest
observation. The legacy rebuild survives ONE release behind the hidden
`spendersLegacyRebuild` setting, then dies (with the legacy chatter-key
path).

**E7 (2026-07-06).** 1.6.0 signed and published
(`https://ext.gosling-agency.ru/updates.json`, sha256-pinned). §5
week-watch: fleet on the version header, kernel-only network panel +
measured quota drop, chatter walkthrough, acceptance observations under
producer `chatgoose-extension@1.6.0`.

**E8 (2026-07-07).** The Stage 35 map regeneration found that
`issueAgencyHubDeviceToken` was UNREACHABLE in shipped 1.6.0:
`getRuntimeRequestType` (src/shared/protocol.ts) had no case for it, so the
options-page sign-in message died before the handler
(src/background/runtime-api.ts) ever ran — device-token sign-in from the
options page silently failed while the legacy chatter-key path kept
everything working (which is why the walkthrough missed it). Fixed by adding
the protocol case, pinned by a test in tests/protocol.test.ts; full check
green. Ships with the NEXT release (alongside the E6 fallback deletions) —
no emergency release, the chatter-key path covers the interim. Add "issue a
device token from the options page" to that release's §5 checks.

**Correction to E3 (2026-07-07, found by the Stage 35 orientation drill):**
E3's line "vendor hosts left in manifest.json host permissions" described a
draft state — the SHIPPED 1.6.0 manifest carries NO vendor AI hosts
(`host_permissions` = fansly.com + apiv3.fansly.com only; the hub rides
`optional_host_permissions`). The current-state authority is CLAUDE.md's
header. E3's text stays as written (append-only log).

**E9 (2026-07-07).** 1.7.0 scope settled: (a) the E8 fix ships (device-token
sign-in reachable); (b) the four legacy-key-only hub ops (testConnection,
pushFanProfile, fetchFanProfileByConversation, submitAiUsageBatch) now
prefer the device token via resolveHubBearer — prerequisite for key-path
deletion; (c) the spendersLegacyRebuild fallback and the legacy per-fan
board rebuild are DELETED (storage v11 drops the setting); (d) the legacy
chatter-key path itself is DEFERRED one more release, against E6's plan —
device_tokens on the kernel is EMPTY (sign-in was broken in 1.6.0, E8), so
deleting the key path now would strand the whole fleet. Delete it only
after the fleet demonstrably holds device tokens.

**E10 (2026-07-07).** Pre-ship GPT-5.5(xhigh) audit of the 1.7.0 diff found
three real defects, all fixed before signing: (1) the options page stored the
placeholder string "set" as the device token after sign-in, which
resolveHubBearer would then SEND as `Bearer set` in the connection test — the
options page now re-reads the real stored settings after sign-in; (2) the
connection test + permission UI were still key-gated, locking out
token-only installs — either credential now unlocks them (helpers take the
token, signature includes it so issuing a token triggers an auto-retest);
(3) resolveHubBearer threw on legacy message shapes without the token field —
now null-safe. Pinned in tests/agency-hub-audit-fixes.test.ts. NOTED, not
changed: the device token lives in storage.local alongside the legacy key
(the E2 custody class; page context cannot read extension storage) — moving
hub credentials out of content-script-readable storage is future hardening,
tracked for the chatter-key-deletion release.
