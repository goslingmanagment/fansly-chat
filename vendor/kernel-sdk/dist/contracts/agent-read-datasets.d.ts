/**
 * Agent Read Plane — the dataset vocabulary.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the dataset name in `POST /agent/pages/:pageLabel/
 * datasets/:dataset/query` is the one open-looking segment of the whole plane, and
 * the registry is the ONLY bridge from that name to code. A string never becomes a
 * table or column name at runtime: the name resolves here, and a field outside the
 * dataset's allowlist is a static 400 BEFORE any SQL. Declaring the vocabulary once
 * (here) and deriving the enums, the catalog response and the filter allowlists from
 * it is the same anti-drift law the claim/plane registry states in its own header.
 *
 * SCOPE: names, field maps, scalar kinds, deterministic sort keys. The SQL mapping
 * (dataset -> table, field -> expression) lands in slice A together with the
 * operation, WITH a mandatory two-way test: every available dataset's declared
 * fields are exactly covered by the runtime mapping, and vice versa. `platforms`
 * and `captureState` — the two remaining catalog-response columns — are runtime
 * facts about a deployment rather than vocabulary, and join in the same slice.
 *
 * Source: the contract appendix §17 dataset catalog (names, fields, default sorts,
 * stable keys and the money-bearing set are copied from it verbatim; the scalar
 * kinds are the appendix's own closed union). Architecture reference:
 * `investigations/agent-read-api-design-2026-07-31.md` §10.

/**
 * Datasets the catalog must NAME rather than hide. The plane's whole premise is
 * that an absent answer is distinguishable from an absent capability, so a hole in
 * the data is declared, not omitted.
 *
 * `fan_earnings` stays planned and untouched: `fan_earnings_stats` exists in the
 * database (migration 0061) but not in the Drizzle schema and is read only by raw
 * SQL. The endpoints-cover initiative deliberately did not adopt it.
 *
 * WHAT LEFT THIS LIST, AND WHERE IT WENT (WP-S1):
 *   `vault_media`, `notifications`, `subscription_tiers`, `comments`, `likes`,
 *   `payouts` — PROMOTED to available above, each over the projection its
 *   capture package landed. Reusing the reserved key rather than minting a new
 *   name is deliberate: a caller that read the catalog a year ago and wrote
 *   `--dataset comments` now gets data instead of a 400.
 *
 *   `purchase_history` — SUPERSEDED by `message_media_sales`. It was never a
 *   dataset: it is a SYNC STREAM name whose canonicalization produces
 *   `message.ppv_unlocked` and which has no serving table at all. The question
 *   it stood for — what was offered and what was bought in DMs — is answered by
 *   `message_media_offers`, which `message_media_sales` serves under the
 *   `read:messages` + `read:money` pairing rule. Keeping the stale key beside
 *   its real answer would have advertised a second, better `purchase_history`
 *   that is never coming.
