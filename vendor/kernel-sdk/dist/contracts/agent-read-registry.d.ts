/**
 * Agent Read Plane — the single source of truth for the claim/plane vocabulary.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (do not "simplify" it back into prose):
 * the design spec restated the same vocabulary in a dozen places — an enum here,
 * a count there, a matrix in the appendix, a pinned number in a test. Three
 * adversarial review rounds each found real defects caused purely by those
 * restatements drifting apart (plane enum said 19 while four other sites still
 * pinned 13; six claim classes in the architecture against four in the contract
 * appendix). The vocabulary is therefore declared ONCE, here, and the enums,
 * counts and required-plane sets are DERIVED. A drift becomes a compile error
 * instead of a silent lie in a response body.
 *
 * SCOPE: this module owns the claim/plane vocabulary only. Per-operation
 * membership (which operation may speak to which fields) lands together with the
 * operations themselves and must be declared HERE when it does — hand-listing it
 * at each route is exactly the drift this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * Design reference: `investigations/agent-read-api-design-2026-07-31.md` §5.

/**
 * A physical store the read plane can consult.
 *
 * `required` planes decide `conclusion.absenceProvable`: if one of them is not
 * `read`, no negative conclusion is possible. `evidentiary` planes are reported
 * in `capture.planes[]` for provenance but never block a conclusion.
 *
 * The split exists because an earlier revision required EVERY plane of a class
 * to be `read`, which included the capture journal — and the journal only
 * begins 2026-07-05 in production, so `absenceProvable` was structurally `false`
 * on every historical window, on both platforms, even with a valid OnlyFans
 * continuity proof. `message_archive` is authoritative for reads; the journal is
 * provenance evidence, already expressed through `fieldStates`/`provenance`.
