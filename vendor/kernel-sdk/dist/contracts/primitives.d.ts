/**
 * Contract primitives shared by more than one route module.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: `routes.ts` grew these as private consts at its top, and
 * every one of them is house vocabulary rather than route-local detail — money is
 * integer mills, a platform is one of two, a boolean query parameter arrives as
 * the string `"true"`. The Agent Read Plane declares its operations in a sibling
 * module (`routes-agent.ts`), and a second copy of `mills` or `platformEnum`
 * there would be exactly the drift that puts two different types for one concept
 * on the wire (see `agent-read-registry.ts`'s header for the same law applied to
 * the claim vocabulary).
 *
 * These declarations were MOVED here verbatim; the extraction commit asserts the
 * generated artifacts (`reference/`, `packages/sdk`) are byte-identical, so the
 * move provably changed no contract.

 *
 * zod's public params omit `pattern`, but its ISO date-time takes a given one
